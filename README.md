## About The Project
The goal of this Model Predictive Control Project was to create and simulate a MPC
controller for a quadcopter. To achieve this goal the given problem was divided into four
independent subproblems (for positions x,y, z and angle gamma), each with its
corresponding separate MPC controller.
Finally, as a bonus exercise, we attempted to implement a non-linear MPC controller for the
quadcopter as a whole, without splitting it.
